### About me

I am passionate about technology and I work professionally with software development since 2013, always applying good programming practices. I'm always looking for new knowledge, growth and professional recognition.

My contact with technology started early on, fixing electronics and developing personal projects in my teens and then performing maintenance on computers where I worked professionally for 5 years. Later I became interested in software development because I wanted applications that didn't exist at the time, so I specialized through a technical course in Mechatronics where I studied everything I like the most, which is electronics and programming (hardware and software). And in 2013 I started working professionally as a developer and I never stopped. 

Today my goal is to help companies through technologies, developing software that impact and transform any company, converting to digital.

Nowadays I'm a PHP Backend Developer.
